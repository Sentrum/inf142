    "At this point, you have learned a couple of cool things. But, what do these have to do with computer networks? The answer is actually straightforward: graphs are used, among other things, to model computer networks (and any kind of network). Think of hosts and packet switches as nodes and the links between them as edges. For instance, the graph $G$ may model a piece of a network consisting of the hosts $4$ and $5$, the routers $2$ and $3$, and the data center $1$. Furthermore, the owner of $1$ is surely interested in minimizing the cost of sending data to $5$ and, therefore, wants to solve the least cost problem by, perhaps, using Dijkstra's algorithm."
