UDP is connectionless it has no need to establish connection. (like a tcp connection)
UDP does not offer reliable data transfer
UDP can be used as a Lightweight protocol that wil give us speed. (low x recvfrom(x))



### long way of writing  sock = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_DGRAM):
address_family = AF_INET
socket_type = SOCK_DGRAM
sock = socket(address_family, socket_type)

recvfrom(bufsize) - recive data from the socket. return value in a pair (bytes, address)
    buffsize    size of the buffer
    bytes       object representing the data recieved
    address     in our case (host, port)

sendto(bytes, address) - send data to the socket. return the number of bytes sent.
    bytes       object representing the data to be sent.
    address     the destination socket's address.
